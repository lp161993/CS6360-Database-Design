# CS6360-Database-Design
To build a database engine

Programming Project:
The aim of the project was to build a database engine, which processed queries.
My project was able to create tables, insert to the tables, drop the tables, create meta data,
and select data from the table based on a where condition. Primarily Random Access file in
Java was used. We can physically move the pointer to one particular byte in these files. So
methods of this class were used to read, write and modify the data. We used a specific
record format with payload and row id. The page had special headers.
Java was the programming language used.
